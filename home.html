			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>Today you will be participating in an IB Psychology Experiment. In this experiment, you will be reading a passage two times. 
			Pay attention to instructions before you begin reading. After each reading, you will be asked to recall what you can remember. 
			Order and spelling will not count against you. </p>
			<p>You have the right to stop your participation at any point during the experiment. 
			The results of the test will remain confidential, and names will not be used in the final report. 
			Student ID's are only used so you can find the results of your test if you wish. If you have any questions, 
			please ask now and refrain from talking during the test. Thank you!</p>
