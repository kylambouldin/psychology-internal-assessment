			<h2>Thank you for participating!</h2>
			<p>The aim of this study is to measure the effects of schema processing on memory recall. The control group read both stories as a homebuyer, and the experimental group read once as a homebuyer, then again as a burglar. It is expected that changing schemas will increase recall. </p>
			<p>Again, you results wil remain confidential and you have the right to withdraw your data. If you would like to see your results, see Mr. Grove or ask me.</p>
